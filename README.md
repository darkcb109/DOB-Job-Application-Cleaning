# Data cleaning for DOB Job Application Filings dataset

The notebook in /DOB Job Application Filings directory does the data profiting and data cleaning job for  DOB Job Application Filings dataset.

Running the notebook in order will download the dataset and clean the data

# other datasets

We have chosen another 10 datasets to evaluate our methods which manually looks into each dataset and manually decide how to clean the data.

The notebooks below clean the data in our original ways, running the notebook in order will download the dataset and clean the data:

'Buildings-Selected-for-the-Alternative-Enforcement-hcir-3275.ipynb'
'DOB-NOW-Build-Approved-Permits-rbx6-tga4.ipynb'
'DOB_Job_Cleaning_Cellular_Antenna_Filings.ipynb'
'DOB_Job_Cleaning_Facades_Compliance_Filings_rr.ipynb'
'DOB_Job_Cleaning_Open_Restaurant_Applications_rr.ipynb'
'DOB_Job_Cleaning_Permit_Issuance_rr.ipynb'
'DOB_NOW_BUILD.ipynb'
'DOB_NOW_Electrical.ipynb'
'Historical_DOB_Permit.ipynb'
'Housing-New-York-Units-by-Building-hg8x-zxpr.ipynb'

However, manually looking into datasets and clean is unefficient, and we can not perform our method to all datasets like this. Thus we have improved and generalized our code which automatically read every datasets, finding potentially problematic columns and clean the data based on our former experience

The notebooks below clean the data in generalized ways, running the notebook in order will only clean the data, make sure you ahve download those datasets in the directory:

'improved.ipynb'
'improved2.ipynb'
